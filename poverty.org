I did look up the definition of poverty and did it right before I posted this thread. It's quite obvious that you did not read my post and just jumped to conclusions. I was very clear when I said that for people that are living in poverty, we should help them. I'm neither a Republican or a Democrat, but go ahead and keep throwing a label on me. I'm sure it makes it easier for you to do that than it is to have a discussion.

Poverty - "the state of being extremely poor"
Extreme - "utmost or exceedingly great in degree"
Poor - "lacking sufficient money to live at a standard considered comfortable or normal in a society."

When I think of poverty I picture people that have no running water, no medical care, living in shed, starving. That lines up with absolute poverty. These are people that can't even get enough food to be properly nourished. I'll say it again in case you missed it the first two time, those people should be helped. Since we both agree on that, at least I hope you agree with me, then you must be speaking about relative poverty.

If being poor means you don't live at a standard that is considered comportable, then what would relative poverty be? Well the US Department of Health and Human services defines poverty as a single person household that makes less than $11,770 a year. If we are speaking about relative poverty in America, then I can agree that this is poverty. That's 15% of Americans. Which means that someone that is making $15,080 a year is not living in poverty, they are poor. So how does the country help those that are poor or living in poverty? 

Well if you make minimum wage or less, you get government assistance for food. A single person that makes minimum wage will receive up to $194 a month. That's $6.25 a day to eat on or about $2.00 a meal. I just checked the Safeway ads and you can get chicken for $1.59 a pound. At 824 calories per pound, you could consume nearly 1/3 of the calories you would need for the day and have $0.65 left over. Fortunately Safeway also had potatoes on sale for $1.79 for a 5lb bag. So for an extra $0.35 you can eat another 1lb of potatoes. So that's 2lbs of food per meal and I spent all of 30 seconds looking at the ads from Safeway. Will it suck to eat? If that's all I could eat month after month, yes it would suck. If I were to actually try to save money, I'd clip coupons, look at ads from different stores, look at other alternatives. etc. Then maybe I could have some variety. In other words, people in America won't be starving to death. 

I don't know about every state, but here in Oregon if you are making minimum wage, you qualify for Obamacare. As a matter of fact if you are a single person making less than $45,960 you can get subsidies to help pay for your Obamacare. So everyone here can get medical care if they need it. Unfortunately, medical care in America is ridiculously expensive still and people can be crushed under the debt, this is something that I think still needs to be addressed, but that doesn't mean you are living in poverty, relative or otherwise.

So individuals making minimum wage in America, get health insurance, we supplement their food. That's what we should be doing. For those that are living in poverty in America, we do even more. We offer housing support, we offer support to pay for electric, gas, telephone and sometimes water. There are even government programs to help with weatherizing residences to reduce energy costs. As a society we should be doing those things and we are. 

If we raise the minimum wage to $10.00 an hour, before taxes they take home $20,800 and after taxes they take home $17,835. Since they are now making too much money to qualify for food or Obamacare, they only take home $12,915. That's less than what they would have taken home at the current minimum wage. Let's say we raise the minimum wage to $15.00 an hour. They would be making $31,200 a year. That means those people no longer get assistance with food. So they lose $2,328 a year. They lose Obamacare, which is another $2,592 a year. After taxes you take home $25,485, then we subtract the food and medical insurance you have to pay for now and your take home is $20,565. The $15 an hour only resulted in a raise of $5,466 a year or $455.50 a month. So somewhere between $10.00 an hour and $15.00 an hour is where everything breaks even for full time employees.
